## Requirements

You can change these values in the `ansible.yaml` if needed.

# Log in to your Azure account

az login

# Use terraform to set up the infrastructure on Azure

cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply

# Use ansible to deploy the service and create a load balancer

cd ../ansible/
az aks get-credentials --resource-group aks-resource-group --name aks-cluster --file ~/config
ansible-playbook ansible.yml
